This model is one of a series of models that are part of the same project
by the above team of researchers. What follows is an abbreviated narrative;
for further details, and the full body of code used in the project, please
see the linked GitHub repositories.

# Data and imputation

https://github.com/ccgilroy/ffc-data-processing/blob/master/vignettes/setup_mi_data.R
https://github.com/ccgilroy/ffc-data-processing/blob/master/vignettes/mi.R
https://github.com/annafil/FFCRegressionImputation

The background data are processed as either continuous or categorical variables,
with some limited manual refinement of the classification. Variables with
insufficient variation or too many missing values are dropped entirely.

The selected subset of variables (described below) are then imputed from a
multivariate normal distribution using the Amelia package. The imputations
were run on the simulation cluster of the Center for Studies in Demography &
Ecology at the University of Washington, supported by a NICHD research
infrastructure grant, R24 HD042828. 5 data sets are imputed, and the predictions
from those data sets are averaged.

# Variable selection and priors

https://github.com/formidable-family/collective_wisdom

We created wiki surveys (https://www.allourideas.org/) to crowd source ideas
about which factors would most influence each of the six outcome in the
Fragile Families Challenge.

We administered this survey to two sets of individuals. We recruited researchers
familiar with the Fragile Families data ("experts") via emails to authors of
previous papers using the data set. We also administered the survey to Amazon
Mechanical Turkers ("MTurkers").

We then matched these ranked ideas to variable names in the Fragile Families
Challenge data set.

This set of predictions uses _all_ variables associated with an outcome in a
survey given to either experts or MTurkers, and it does not use any other
covariates. The set of covariates used for each outcome is distinct, and each
set consists of roughly 150 variables.

This set of predictions does not make use of the score (ranking) of each
variable. All variables are equally regularized.

# Model

https://github.com/formidable-family/ffc-modeling-pipeline

The model itself is an elasticnet model using the glmnet package. This means
that all covariates are regularized or shrunk toward zero, allowing the model
to make use of more covariates with less overfitting. The degree of
regularization is determined by a lambda parameter tuned through
cross-validation.

Alpha values are closer to 0 than 1, making the model more like ridge regression
than lasso regression. The alpha values were tuned on the training data set
only, using cross-validation; different values of alpha did not appear to
produce particularly different results in terms of out-of-sample mean squared
error.

The code included for submission to the challenge only contains the most
critical and immediate parts of the entire data processing, prior, and
modeling pipeline. To fully reproduce the results, please use the entire code
and directory structure of the linked modeling repository, inserting the data
and variable information from the above sections in the appropriate
subdirectories.
